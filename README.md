build a RNN model to suggest autocompletion of half typed words.

The aim of the project is to build a RNN model to suggest autocompletion of half typed words. You may have seen this in many day today applications; typing an email, a text message etc. For example, suppose you type in the four letter "univ", the application may suggest you to autocomplete it by "university".
